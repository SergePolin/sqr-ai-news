# Testing Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the testing system for the AI-Powered News Aggregator project.

## UI Testing (Selenium)

### Key Improvements

- **Fixed language issues**: Updated selectors from Russian to English text in all UI tests
- **Multiple selector strategies**: Implemented robust `try_multiple_selectors` function that tries different approaches to find UI elements
- **Enhanced error handling**: Added extensive debug logging to provide better diagnostics when tests fail
- **Simplified tests**: Focused on core functionality rather than complex features that may be unstable
- **Improved test documentation**: Added README.md with testing approach and troubleshooting information

### Benefits

- **Higher stability**: Tests now pass consistently across different environments
- **Better diagnostics**: Failed tests provide more information to help identify the root cause
- **Lower maintenance**: Tests are less brittle to minor UI changes
- **Better documentation**: New developers can understand the testing approach more easily

## Performance Testing

### Key Improvements

- **Authentication enhancements**: Implemented token sharing between virtual users
- **Automatic re-authentication**: Added support for automatic re-authentication on 401 errors
- **Enhanced reporting**: Created detailed performance reports with metrics
- **Standalone test runner**: Added a dedicated script for running performance tests in CI/CD

### Benefits

- **More accurate results**: Tests now properly authenticate, eliminating errors from unauthenticated requests
- **Better reliability**: Tests recover from authentication failures
- **Improved documentation**: Detailed reports help track performance over time
- **CI/CD integration**: Tests can be easily run in automated pipelines

## General Testing Improvements

### Test Coverage

- Current test coverage is at 51% for the application codebase
- UI tests now contribute to the coverage metrics
- All critical paths are now tested

### Documentation

- Added README files to explain testing approach
- Added troubleshooting guides for common testing issues
- Improved code comments in test files

### Future Improvements

1. **Increase test coverage**: Target at least 60% coverage (currently 51%)
2. **Add more UI tests**: Cover more complex user interactions
3. **Fix deprecated code warnings**: Update code to use non-deprecated APIs
4. **Add screenshot capture**: Capture screenshots when UI tests fail for better debugging
5. **Add more security tests**: Enhance testing for security vulnerabilities
