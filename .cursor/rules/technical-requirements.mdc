# Technical Implementation Requirements

## Architecture

The AI-Powered News Aggregator should follow a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **API Layer**: FastAPI endpoints that handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Service Layer**: Business logic that processes data and manages operations
- **Data Access Layer**: Database interactions via SQLAlchemy ORM
- **External Services Layer**: Integration with NewsAPI, Firebase Auth, etc.

## Core Requirements

- Minimum of three major interconnected features
- Each team member must implement at least one separate functionality
- **Mandatory External API Integration**: The application must integrate with at least one external API (e.g., NewsAPI, Firebase Auth)
- **Simple UI for Testing**: A minimal UI must be implemented to facilitate Selenium testing

## Backend Requirements

### Technology Stack

- **Python 3.11**: Base programming language
- **FastAPI**: Web framework for building APIs
- **SQLite**: Database for local development
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **Poetry**: Dependency management for environment and dependencies

### API Design

- RESTful API design principles
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for auto-generated API docs
- JSON responses with consistent structure
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Rate limiting for public endpoints

### Authentication

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure password handling (no plaintext storage)
- Token refresh mechanism

## Frontend Requirements

### Technology Stack

- **Streamlit**: Primary framework for frontend development
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

### User Experience

- Intuitive navigation
- Fast page loads
- Clear error messages
- Accessible design
- Testable UI elements for Selenium tests

## Data Management

### Database

- Proper indexing for frequently queried fields
- Database migrations for schema changes
- Connection pooling

### Caching

- Cache frequently accessed data
- Implement cache invalidation strategies

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing

- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Target â‰¥60% line coverage (minimum)
- Cover edge cases and error scenarios

### Integration Testing

- Test component interactions
- Verify API contracts
- Test database operations

### End-to-End Testing

- Simulate user journeys
- Test critical business flows
- **Selenium Testing**: Implement UI tests with Selenium

### Other Testing Methods

- **Mutation Testing**: Use mutmut to verify test quality
- **Fuzz Testing**: Implement with hypothesis where applicable
- **Stress Testing**: Verify system behavior under load
- **Exploratory Testing**: Document manual testing findings

## Security Requirements

### OWASP Top 10

- Protection against:
  - Injection attacks
  - Broken authentication
  - Sensitive data exposure
  - XML External Entities (XXE)
  - Broken access control
  - Security misconfigurations
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Insecure deserialization
  - Components with known vulnerabilities
  - Insufficient logging & monitoring

### API Security

- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize outputs
- Implement HTTPS
- Use secure headers
- Implement proper CORS

## Monitoring and Logging

- Structured logging
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking
- Usage analytics

## Deployment

- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline via GitHub
- Environment-specific configurations
- Backup and restore procedures
