# Quality Metrics Requirements

This document outlines the specific metrics and thresholds that the AI-Powered News Aggregator project must meet to be considered production-ready.

## Code Quality Metrics

### Static Analysis

| Metric | Tool | Threshold | Description |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Style Compliance | Flake8/Ruff | 0 warnings | Code must follow PEP 8 style guide |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | SonarQube | ≤ 10 per function | Measures code complexity |
| Code Duplication | SonarQube | < 5% | Percentage of duplicated code |
| Code Smells | SonarQube | < 20 per 1000 lines | Potential problems in code |

### Testing

| Metric | Tool | Threshold | Description |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Line Coverage | pytest-cov/coverage | ≥ 60% (minimum) | Percentage of code lines executed by tests |
| Branch Coverage | pytest-cov/coverage | ≥ 60% | Percentage of code branches executed by tests |
| Test Success Rate | pytest | 100% | All tests must pass |
| Mutation Score | mutmut | ≥ 60% | Percentage of bugs detected by tests |
| Fuzz Testing | hypothesis | Configurable | Property-based testing for edge cases |

## Performance Metrics

### API Performance

| Metric | Tool | Threshold | Description |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Response Time | Locust/k6/JMeter | ≤ 200ms (p95) | 95% of requests complete within 200ms |
| Throughput | Locust/k6/JMeter | ≥ 100 req/sec | Minimum requests per second |
| Error Rate | Locust/k6/JMeter | < 0.1% | Percentage of failed requests |
| Time to First Byte | Locust/k6/JMeter | < 50ms | Time until first byte received |

### Database Performance

| Metric | Tool | Threshold | Description |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Query Time | SQLAlchemy Stats | < 50ms (p95) | 95% of database queries complete within 50ms |
| Connection Pool Usage | SQLAlchemy Stats | < 80% | Percentage of connection pool in use |

## Security Metrics

### Vulnerability Management

| Metric | Tool | Threshold | Description |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Critical Vulnerabilities | Bandit/OWASP Dependency-Check/Snyk | 0 | Number of critical security vulnerabilities |
| High Vulnerabilities | Bandit/OWASP Dependency-Check/Snyk | 0 | Number of high security vulnerabilities |
| Medium Vulnerabilities | Bandit/OWASP Dependency-Check/Snyk | < 5 | Number of medium security vulnerabilities |
| Dependency Freshness | pip-audit | < 3 months | Maximum age of dependencies |

### Security Tests

| Metric | Tool | Threshold | Description |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| OWASP Top 10 Coverage | OWASP ZAP | 100% | Tests covering all OWASP Top 10 risks |
| Security Test Coverage | Custom | ≥ 90% | Percentage of security requirements tested |
| Sensitive Data Exposure | Custom | 0 occurrences | No exposure of sensitive data |
| Authentication Tests | Selenium/pytest | 100% pass | All authentication flows tested |

## Reliability Metrics

| Metric | Tool | Threshold | Description |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Uptime | Monitoring | ≥ 99.9% | Percentage of time service is available |
| Mean Time Between Failures | Monitoring | ≥ 720 hours | Average time between system failures |
| Mean Time To Recovery | Monitoring | ≤ 15 minutes | Average time to recover from failures |
| Recovery Tests | Custom | 100% pass | All recovery mechanisms tested |

## Documentation Metrics

| API Response Time | Custom | ≤ 500ms | External API response time monitoring |
| Fallback Coverage | pytest | 100% | All fallback mechanisms for API failures tested |

## Measuring and Reporting

- Quality metrics should be measured in CI/CD pipeline through GitHub Actions
- Quality reports should be generated after each build
- Trend analysis should be performed weekly
- Quality gates must be passed before deployment to production
